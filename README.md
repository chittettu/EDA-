# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves examining and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset. EDA helps you understand the structure and patterns within the data, identify anomalies, and gain insights that can guide further analysis. Here are the key details and steps involved in EDA:

Data Collection:

Gather the dataset you want to analyze. This data can come from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, APIs, or web scraping.
Data Understanding:

Examine the data's structure: Check the number of rows and columns, data types, and the presence of missing values.
Explore the first few rows of the dataset to get a sense of the data's format.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing data: Decide on an imputation strategy (e.g., using SimpleImputer) or remove rows or columns with missing values.
Remove duplicates if necessary.
Handle outliers, if applicable.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics for the numerical variables, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.
Generate frequency tables and counts for categorical variables.
Create visualizations, like histograms, box plots, and bar charts, to better understand the distribution of data.
Data Visualization:

Create various types of plots and visualizations to explore the data. Common plots include:
Histograms for data distribution.
Box plots for detecting outliers.
Scatter plots for examining relationships between variables.
Bar charts for categorical data.
Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features or transform existing ones if it can lead to better insights or model performance.
Correlation Analysis:

Calculate and visualize correlations between numerical variables (e.g., using a correlation matrix or a heatmap).
Identify strong correlations that may indicate multicollinearity or provide insights into relationships within the data.
